        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year student at University of California, Riverside aiming to get a degree in Finance.  My passion for finance and investing started over the summer before my freshman year. My class was required to take a personal finance
        course as part of our summer program, and the class captured my attention very quickly. The class taught us about saving, credit cards, and most importantly to me, investing.
        Ever since falling in love with finance, I strive to help whomever I can realize their financial goals and reach them. This is the reason why I decided to teach a personal finance
        course at my high school to incoming freshman during the summer after I graduated. It is very important to teach the younger generation of students how to invest and teach them how to achieve financial independence
        Even though not all the students were enthustiastic, there were a few who enjoyed what we were learning and wanted to have long conversations with me about what they were learning and about how 
        I invested. It was nice to see when I went back to visit during the school year, those same students talked to me with the same excitement and enthusiasm. I loved the impact I had on these students
        and it's the reason why I strive to help other people. Using the knowledge I have gained so far, I have been able
        to help friends, and older professionals realize the importance of investing and help them create a portfolio and plan for them to reach their goals quicker. My goal is to turn this passion I have into a career and continue helping others. It is very important to me to have an impact in helping others towards self-improvement.<br><br>
       Throughout my high school career, I have had multiple experiences in an office environment which have enabled me to gain professional skills and learn under the mentorship of experienced
       professionals. I have earned the opportunity to work at Facebook and at Kaiser Permanente as an intern.
        <br><br>
        At both Facebook and Kaiser Permanente, I was tasked with interacting with employees and members and helping make their experience as enjoyable as possible. At Facebook, I worked in the IT and Oculus Departments. In the IT department, I was responsible
        for troubleshooting any problems that employees were having or direct them to another department that would be able to help solve their problems more effectively. In the Oculus Department, I was tasked with testing and preparing Oculus headsets
        to be shipped out to big technology events. At Kaiser Permanente, I was in the Member Services department, whose main task is to 
        simplify everything in the hospital so the members have the most enjoyable and simple experience. One of the things I did to gain 
        this information was to stand outside the main entrances of the hospital and guide members to their desired locations. I also went
        around to multiple departments and interviewed employees about the technology that was utilized in different departments. I then
        took this information and presented it to hospital executives.
